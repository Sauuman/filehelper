See (limited) tests for example usage. This package is used by some other projects, you might find it useful as well, but this package is a borderline anti-pattern.

Main responsibilities:

* read and write csv
* unified file read for csv, xml or json with extendible parsing
* template parsing with handy functions - see tests
